				<p>Langkawi isn’t just one big island, but a collection of around 100 islands that form an archipelago.
				While most are uninhabited, a few have been designated for tourism so that visitors from all over the
				world can admire and appreciate the magical beauty of Langkawi. There are many island tours available from
				operators to get you started. Note that most tours do not operate during the monsoon season from July to
				mid-September as the seas become choppy and potentially dangerous.</p>

				<p>The Langkawi Sky Bridge is located at the 'end' of the Cable Car ride. One of the island’s highlights, it is a 410ft-long curved
				pedestrian bridge above Mount Mat Cinchang. It may sound like a cliché but it is really true - the views from here are simply stunning-great
				for those Kodak moments! Located 2,300ft above sea level, the Sky Bridge is easily accessible by the Langkawi Cable Car. Once the cable car
				gets going it gets a little chilly as winds flow through the ventilation slits at the top.</p>
