				<p>The Labuan Clock Tower is an exact replica of the original clock tower built in 1906 by Chee Swee Cheng, a tycoon and philanthropist
				from Malacca and the first chairman of the Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC Bank). It was one of several standing structures
				that survived World War II, the others being The Chimney, a hospital and the lighthouses on Pulau Kuraman and Pulau Papan. Intense naval
				bombardments by Allied forces completely devastated Victoria (Bandar Labuan), the island’s capital.</p>

				<h3>Peace Park</h3><hr>
				<p>Set in a beautifully landscaped area, the Peace Park in Labuan, Malaysia, serves as a World War II memorial and poignant reminder of the horrors
				of war. Labuan was under Japanese occupation for four years before being yielded to Allied Forces on 10th September 1945. The park was built by the
				Japanese as a symbol of peace, harmony and friendship as well as a tribute to those who lost their lives in Borneo during World War II. Also known
				as Taman Damai, the Peace Park’s serene grounds feature a large, raised memorial mound surrounded by two prominent arched walls, picturesque gazebos
				as well as Japanese-themed ponds and bridges.</p>

				<h3>Chimney Museum</h3><hr>
				<p>The Labuan Chimney is a well-known and often-photographed attraction on the island. Built in the early 1900s, this historical landmark is a remnant of
				Labuan’s coal mining era, which peaked under the administration of the British North Borneo Chartered Company. Measuring over 32 m (106 ft) in height, the
				imposing structure is made from over 23,000 pieces of unplastered red bricks imported from Britain. Conservation work on the chimney’s tower undertaken by
				Malaysia’s Department of Museums was globally recognized in 2013 when Labuan Corporation became a bronze medal winner of the Green Apple Awards for the Built
				Environment and Architectural Heritage.</p>
