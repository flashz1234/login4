				<h3>Bukit Bintang</h3><hr>
				<p>Bukit Bintang (Bintang Walk) is well-regarded as Kuala Lumpur’s trendiest shopping and entertainment district, offering everything
				from sleek shopping centres and five-star hotels to all-day restaurants and vibrant nightclubs. Thanks to its central location, it is
				also fairly easy to get to Bukit Bintang from anywhere in Kuala Lumpur via public transportation, including monorail, taxis, and buses.
				One of the most iconic landmarks here is Pavilion KL, an upscale shopping mall that houses European luxury retailers.</p>

				<h3>Petronas Towers</h3><hr>
				<p>Petronas Twin Towers were once the tallest buildings in the world. Standing 452 metres tall, the Petronas Twin Towers retained
				its world-title claim to fame until 2004. At the base of the Twin Towers is Suria KLCC, an upmarket shopping mall that is very
				popular with tourists. Stretching out to the side of the Twin Towers is the spacious and beautifully landscaped KLCC Park which
				features a jogging track, walking paths, a water fountain and a wading pool for children.</p>

				<h3>Kuala Lumpur Tower</h3><hr>
				<p>Kuala Lumpur Tower is easily Malaysia’s most recognizable and popular landmark. Constructed in 1994, the tower stands at 421 metres
				and effortlessly trumps the Petronas Twin Towers with the highest and most spectacular view of the city. This gleaming tower’s spindle-like
				apex is visible from almost anywhere in KL. When it was originally built, the natural surroundings of Bukit Nanas were kept intact
				to ensure balance in development; in fact a 100-year-old Jelutong tree was preserved, at great cost, by building a retaining wall around it.</p>

				<h3>Petaling Street</h3><hr>
				<p>A well-known shopping district, the whole area transforms into a lively and vibrant night market after dark, with hundreds of stalls selling all
				kinds of stuff at dirt-cheap prices, making it the most happening night market in the city. Since then, Petaling Street has been given a facelift.
				Gone are the patchy roads, broken pavements and colourful umbrellas attached to wooden pushcarts lining the street on both sides. A green awning covers
				the length of the street, acting as a roof to shield vendors and shoppers from the heat and the rain.</p>
